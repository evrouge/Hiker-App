# Hiker App

### I created this CRUD app for people like me who love to hike and keep track of their hikes without having to use a boring excel spreadsheet!

### I used Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, EJS, Javascript, and CSS to create this app.

### In this app, I was able to create space for anyone to input a name of a hike, the mileage of a hike, a description, the rating of the hike (radio buttons: easy, moderate, difficult), a checkbox showing whether this hike has been completed or not, and lastly to add a picture url that also displays on the main page as well.

### I would like to add more to this app. I think that it would be really fun to make it a social media type app where users can see each other's hikes as well and save hikes that they would want to do in the future. I would also like to separate the hikes by ones that have been completed and others that have not yet been completed.

### You are able to update/edit the hikes currently in the database, delete a hike, and create a new hike. Please don't delete what I currently have in here! Hoping to add a user login function soon so others can use this as well if they would like to!

### Project deployed on Heroku:
